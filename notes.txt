Create exercise for case study: have reader implement is_symmetric (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph)

Interesting Algorithm Design: Formal Knotting Algorithm, Noam's knotting algorithm. Compare.

Paper: Knotting Paper
Replicate: We could find an experiment that ties in small world graphs, directedness, knotting etc.
Extend: Specialize/Specify Allen's code to make Directed Graphs
Algorithm Design: Knots
Module: NetworkX
Philosophy: Nahhhhhh
